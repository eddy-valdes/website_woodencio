                <h1>Hi There</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">How do you do? My name is Woodencio Madeiros, a pretty normal name. It is my name
                    after
                    all.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I am a piece of wood. I have my body, my legs, my arms and my thoughts. I know I look a little stiff,
                    but
                    I am as open minded as a squared piece of wood could be. I also have glasses. I wear glasses because
                    I
                    have myopia and not because I want to make a fashion statement or something. </p>
                <p>In my free time I like to wander around the garden enjoying life and beauty. I am very young but I
                    have
                    an old soul or something, because I like the slow pacing things. Maybe I am more older than I think
                    or I
                    inherit the experience of previous lives as a tree or something. I do not know for sure. What I know
                    is
                    that I like to enjoy the little things of life, because no one really knows what the future awaits
                    for
                    us.</p>
                <p>During my travels around I make lots of friends and acquaintances that make life more bearable.
                    Friendship is very important, is the family you choose and the one is going to be for you when you
                    need
                    it. You have to be for them too when they need it, of course. Friendship is a two way branch. Or is
                    it a
                    two way street? Any way, don’t take it from me, ask all my friends how awesome I am. </p>

                <p>Oh yeah, Woodencio. I have seen him before walking around. He likes to walk around. I do not. I
                    prefer to stay in one place.</p>

                    with that name. Sorry. Woodencio, you said?.</p>

            <p>When I was little I liked to look for the sun and photosynthesize, but I grew up as a piece of wood an no
                longer do that stuff. Now if I am at the sun is just to enjoy it. And to get a good tan. Oh, I love to
                have a good tan, but also I have to care about my skin because of melanoma. Wait a minute... do I have
                skin? Do I even like lying in the sun to get a good tan? Do I really like Taylor Swift’s music or do I
                felt compelled to like it because of society?</p>
            <p>Talking about music, I enjoy the sound of nature. Nothing like the whisper of tree leaves moved by the
                wind, the chanting of the little droplets of rain in the grass, the murmur of the plants while growing,
                the slow pace of the snail in the night, the singing of the birds in the summer, the cheerful croaking
                of the frogs in the pond, the mysterious howling of the wolf under the full moon. I also like listening
                to death metal.</p>
