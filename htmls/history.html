                pretty boring stuff.</p>

                <p>My story is fascinating. I was a piece of wood. Amazing, right? I was lying around in the floor
                    collecting dust with other friendly pieces of wood and suddenly I came to life and decided that I
                    want a
                    website to share my persona so everyone in this planet and beyond knows me.</p>
                <p>Some say that a powerful divine entity create everything around us, including us created in its same
                    squared wooden image. Others say that millions of years ago there was a huge explosion called The
                    Big
                    Splinter that created the elementary particles that make up the universe and stars and galaxies were
                    formed. And in a forgettable corner of the universe, on a random planet, a poorly evolved ape who
                    had no
                    idea what topic to cover for a final website project looked at the mess in his room and saw a piece
                    of
                    wood lying on the floor and he had an epiphany. Nonsenses.</p>
                <p>So here I am living my life, thinking about the future no matter how depressing. I could end up
                    working
                    as a piece of furniture, like a chair, a coaster, a bookshelf or a coffee table. Or I could end up
                    in an
                    intense and short life burning as firewood in a barbecue, just like a famous actor consumed by the
                    fame.
                    Or I can end up in a boring life like the block that keeps the table from limping. We will see.</p>

                <p>My family have a lot of history too. I came from a timber line of wooden members. My
                    great-great-great-great-great-grandma was a pine tree stump, my great-great-grandpa was a wood
                    mallet,
                    my great-grandma was an hickory spoon, my mother was a war axe handle (we are a complex family) and
                    I am
                    an industrial serrated piece of pine wood with a lot of potential.</p>
                <p>We also have enemies, specially my mother’s side of the family the trees. Axes, saws, machetes, in
                    love
                    teenagers with a knife carving a heart in a tree’s bark, chainsaws, termite, fire, humidity. But the
                    worse of all are the humans, those idiots monkeys! </p>
